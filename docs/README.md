# Shopper Approved

This app provides blocks for the Shopper Approved survey, widget, and seal components, which allow shoppers to submit and view reviews of your store as a whole.

The app provides the following blocks:

- `shop-review-badge.shopper-approved-seal`: This block displays the average rating for your store and is typically placed in the footer. Shoppers can click the seal to visit the Shopper Approved site where all of the reviews of your store are listed.

- `shop-review-badge.shopper-approved-widget`: This block displays a paginated list of reviews of your store. This block is typically placed in a sidebar or perhaps on its own page of your site.

- `shop-review-badge.shopper-approved-survey`: This block opens a popup that prompts the shopper to submit a review of your store. This block is typically placed on the Order Placed page so that the shopper will be prompted to leave a review after placing an order.

## Configuration
